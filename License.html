For the purposes of this License, a product suite consisting of two or more products is considered a single product (operating system distributions and cover media of magazines are not considered product suites).<br>
<br><b>5</b>. &quot;Distribution&quot; means (and &quot;distribute&quot; refers to), regardless of means or methods, conveyance, transfer, providing, or making available of This/Your Product or portions thereof to third parties (including, but not limited to, making This/Your Product, or portions thereof, available for download to third parties, whether or not any third party has downloaded the product, or any portion thereof, made available for download).<br>
<br><br>
<br><b>II. Use, Copying, and Distribution of This Product</b><br>
<br>
<b>1</b>.

  </li>
  <li>Phrase &quot;<i>Based on TrueCrypt, freely available at http://www.truecrypt.org/</i>&quot; must be displayed by Your Product (if technically feasible) and contained in its documentation. Alternatively, if This Product or its portion You included in Your Product constitutes only a minor portion of Your Product, phrase &quot;<i>Portions of this product are based in part on TrueCrypt, freely available at http://www.truecrypt.org/</i>&quot; may be displayed instead. In each of the cases mentioned above in this paragraph, &quot;<i>http://www.truecrypt.org/</i>&quot; must be a hyperlink (if technically feasible) pointing to http://www.truecrypt.org/ and You may freely choose the location within the user interface (if there is any) of Your Product (e.g., an &quot;About&quot; window, etc.) and the way in which Your Product will display the respective phrase.<br>

  Your Product (and any associated materials, e.g., the documentation, the content of the official web site of Your Product, etc.) must not present any Internet address containing the domain name truecrypt.org (or any domain name that forwards to the domain name truecrypt.org) in a manner that might suggest that it is where information about Your Product may be obtained or where bugs found in Your Product may be reported or where support for Your Product may be available or otherwise attempt to indicate that the domain name truecrypt.org is associated with Your Product.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li>The complete source code of Your Product must be freely and publicly available (for exceptions, see Section III.2) at least until You cease to distribute Your Product. This condition can be met in one or both of the following ways: (i) You include the complete source code of Your Product with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute and You make all such copies of Your Product available to the general public free of charge, and/or (ii) You include information (valid and correct at least until You cease to distribute Your Product) about where the complete source code of Your Product can be obtained free of charge (e.g., an Internet address) or for a reasonable reproduction fee with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute and, if there is a web site officially associated with Your Product, You include the aforementioned information about the source code on a freely and publicly accessible web page to which such web site links via an easily viewable hyperlink (at least until You cease to distribute Your Product).<br>
    <br>
The source code of Your Product must not be deliberately obfuscated and it must not be in an intermediate form (e.g., the output of a preprocessor). Source code means the preferred form in which a programmer would usually modify the program.<br>
    <br>
  Portions of the source code of Your Product not contained in This Product (e.g., portions added by You in creating Your Product, whether created by You or by third parties) must be available under license(s) that (however, see also Subsection III.1.e) allow(s) anyone to modify and derive new works from the portions of the source code that are not contained in This Product and to use, copy, and redistribute such modifications and/or derivative works. The license(s) must be perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge, and worldwide, and must not invalidate, weaken, restrict, interpret, amend, modify, interfere with or otherwise affect any part, term, provision, or clause of this License. The text(s) of the license(s) must be included with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>You must not change the license terms of This Product in any way (adding any new terms is considered changing the license terms even if the original terms are retained), which means, e.g., that no part of This Product may be put under another license. You must keep intact all the legal notices contained in the source code files. You must include the following items with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute: a clear and conspicuous notice stating that Your Product or portion(s) thereof is/are governed by this version of the TrueCrypt License, a verbatim copy of this version of the TrueCrypt License (as contained herein), a clear and conspicuous notice containing information about where the included copy of the License can be found, and an appropriate copyright notice.<br>
